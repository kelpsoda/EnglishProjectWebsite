        <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
        <p>Climate change is the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as variations in the solar cycle. However, since the 1800s, human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas have been the main driver of climate change. These fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

        <h2>Who is to blame for climate change?</h2>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), such as those from the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, energy, and industrial operations, are the principal contributors to climate change in the United States. Included are the gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming, <img src="Climate-change-pics/greenhouse-gas-emissions.jpg">such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases. The contribution of transportation to climate change is also highlighted in the Chicago Climate Action Plan. The use of petroleum-based fuels in cars, trucks, and airplanes makes transportation one of the main causes of GHG emissions in the US. The plan mentions another factor in climate change known as the urban heat island effect, which happens when cities trap heat because of their large population centers and paved surfaces.
            
        Overall, human activities that generate GHGs, especially through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and land-use changes, are the primary causes of climate change in America, just as they are the primary causes of climate change worldwide. A variety of solutions will be needed to combat climate change, including the use of renewable energy, the promotion of energy efficiency, the reduction of transportation emissions, the preservation of forests, and the implementation of climate-smart urban planning.
