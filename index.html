            <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
            <p>Climate change is the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as variations in the solar cycle. However, since the 1800s, human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas have been the main driver of climate change. These fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

            <h2>What are the main causes of climate change in America?</h2>
            <p1>
                Climate change in America is mainly caused by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, which result in the emission of greenhouse gases, leading to global warming, sea level rise, and extreme weather patterns.
            
                According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in America, which accounts for about 78% of all emissions, is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas (EPA, 2021). The largest emitters of fossil fuels are the industrial and residential sectors, followed by the transportation sector, which includes vehicles like cars, trucks, and airplanes.

        </p1>
            <p2>
                The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary cause of the 1.1Â°C rise in the global mean temperature since pre-industrial times (IPCC, 2021). According to the report, if emissions continue to rise at their current rate, the average global temperature will be  more than 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution by the end of the century, which will result in more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and other extreme weath
            </p2>
            <p1>
                Another cause for climate change is deforestation. Deforestation is the clearing of forested land. The EPA estimates that deforestation and other land-use changes in America contribute to approximately 11% of total greenhouse gas emissions (EPA, 2021). In addition to its contribution to climate change, deforestation also leads to habitat loss, biodiversity loss, and soil erosion.
            </p1>
            
            <p2>
                As reported by the EPA, agriculture is another significant source of greenhouse gas emissions in America, contributing about 10% of all emissions (EPA, 2021). Manure management, enteric fermentation, and synthetic fertilizers are the main sources of agricultural emissions.

            <p2>
                Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is produced during the digestive process of animals and is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period (EPA, 2021). Methane is also produced during the management of manure, and synthetic fertilizers also release nitrous oxide, a strong greenhouse gas.
            </p2>
        
            <p1>
                Some may argue that climate change is caused by natrual events such as solar radiation, volcanic activity, and natural cycles also contribute to climate change, even though human activity is the main cause of it in America. The EPA asserts that natural causes cannot fully account for the present warming trend seen today(EPA, 2021). Furthermore, research has revealed that while greenhouse gas concentrations have significantly increased over the past few decades, natural factors have ultimately remained constant (NASA, 2021).

        <div class="Second-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 100px;"><div id="Question-2"></div>
            <h2>Who is to blame for climate change?</h2>
            <p1>
                Even though there are many reasons for climate change, with both natural events like volcanic eruptions and man-made ones like industrial growth and deforestation, it is people, businesses, and governments who have made the biggest contributions to the issue.
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>
                While it is simple to blame businesses and governments for climate change, individuals also have a big part to play in the issue. According to a Harvard Political Review report, people are responsible for about 40% of the world's carbon emissions (Harvard Political Review). This is largely a result of lifestyle decisions regarding things like energy use, diet, and transportation. For instance, using an inefficient vehicle, consuming meat, and leaving appliances on standby all increase carbon emissions.
            </p2>
            <br><br>
            <p1>
                The concept of "carbon footprint" is another aspect of personal responsibility for climate change. Your "Carbon footprint" is the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that you released into the atmosphere as a result of your daily activites such as driving or using electricity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average carbon footprint of a person in the United States is approximately 16 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Technology Review). This highlights the need for people to accept personal responsibility for their actions because it is significantly higher than the average for the entire globe.
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>
                Corporations contribute significantly to climate change as well. Just 100 companies are accountable for 71% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a report by CDP, a nonprofit organization that monitors corporate environmental performance (Technology Review). This emphasizes the necessity for businesses to accept accountability for their deeds and put in place sustainable practices that can lessen their carbon footprint.
            </p2>  
            <br><br>
            <p1>
                Some argue may that businesses have financial motivations to downplay or deny their contributions to the issue of climate change. One expert argues this in an article published by The Leaflet that many businesses are more focused on increasing profits than on preserving the environment (The Leaflet). This has produced a culture of denial, where corporations fund climate-denying research and lobby governments to delay or weaken climate policies. diminution of their carbon footprint.
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>
                Even though people and organizations are partly responsible for climate change, the evidence points to other factors as the main offenders. While individuals and small businesses do contribute to emissions, their effects are not as significant as those of large corporations. Governments also share some of the blame for their inability to control these businesses and provide incentives for more environmentally friendly behavior. However, it is obvious that businesses that have put shareholder value ahead of environmental protection are to blame for the majority of climate change.

        <div class="Third-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 100px;"><div id="Question-3"></div>
            <h2>Is there corporate incentive to deny climate change</h2>
            <p1>
                There is a corporate incentive to belittle climate change because as it can be more profitable for corporations to stick with environmentally harmful practices like burning fossil fuels rather than switching to sustainable ones.
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>
                Many businesses have financial incentives to belittle or deny the severity of climate change because making the switch to more sustainable practices such as solar or wind power, can be expensive and disruptive to their business models. The fossil fuel industry has reportedly spent millions of dollars on propaganda and misinformation and lobbyists who seek to defame climate scientists, according to a report by The Leaflet (The Leaflet, 2019). This includes disseminating false information and supporting groups and think tanks that reject climate change.
            </p2>
            <br><br>
            <p1>
                Additionally, businesses might reject rules that would limit their emissions or force them to switch to cleaner energy sources because those rules could cost them a lot of money. In the US, some businesses have lobbied against the Clean Air Act and other environmental regulations (SSIR, 2017). Because of this lobbying and defaming, tyrannical business owners can continue to pump greenhouse gas into the atmosphere and make the entire world pay without any consequences.
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>
                Many businesses prioritize short-term profits over sustainability, which can make it challenging for them to give sustainability and climate change mitigation top priority. This is especially true for businesses that have publicly traded stock because those businesses may come under pressure from investors to put short-term profits ahead of long-term sustainability.

                A lack of investment in the research and development of sustainable technologies, as well as a reluctance to take risks in the switch to renewable energy sources, can also result from this short-term orientation.
            </p2>
            <br><br>
            <p1>
                While some businesses may deny sustainability initiatives or contest the existence of climate change, many others are making efforts to decrease their environmental impact and switch to cleaner energy sources.

                According to a report by SSIR, "corporate sustainability initiatives have grown from a niche concern to a mainstream trend" (SSIR, 2017). This includes businesses vowing to use renewable energy, cut emissions, and invest in sustainable technologies.
                
                Furthermore, some businesses are taking action to address the financial risks associated with climate change. Assessing how climate change will affect their supply chains and business operations, as well as investing in climate resilience measures, are part of this.

            <h2>Is it too late to combat climate change? <br> if not, what steps should we take to mitigate damages caused by climate change?</h2>
            <p1>
                Even though the effects of climate change are already being felt on a global scale, it is still possible to stop some of its worst effects. But in order to prevent the worst effects of global warming and guarantee a sustainable future for present and future generations, urgent and immediate action is needed. The younger generation is more engaged in climate action than ever before. Many young people around the world have taken to the streets to demand action on climate change. This increased awareness and advocacy for the environment has led to a greater sense of urgency to address climate change (Bard Center for Environmental Policy, 2021).
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>
                NASA claims that if we take immediate action, we still have time to stop the worst effects of climate change. With regard to global warming, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has set a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. If we cut carbon emissions and use more renewable energy sources, we can achieve this goal (NASA, 2022).
            </p2>
            <br><br>
            <p1>
                One of the measures we can take as a society to enure a sustibable future is the switch to renewable energy sources is one of the best ways to reduce the effects of climate change. Examples of renewable energy sources that can lessen carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change include solar, wind, and hydroelectric power (NASA, 2022).
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>
                Individual actions can also mitigate the effects of climate change. Utilizing public transportation and reducing plastic waste are two easy ways to cut carbon emissions and lessen the effects of climate change. Additionally, people can promote climate action and exert pressure on policymakers to act (NASA, 2022).
