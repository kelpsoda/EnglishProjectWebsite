        <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
        <p>Climate change is the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as variations in the solar cycle. However, since the 1800s, human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas have been the main driver of climate change. These fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
