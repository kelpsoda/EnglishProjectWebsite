        <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
        <p>Climate change is the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as variations in the solar cycle. However, since the 1800s, human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas have been the main driver of climate change. These fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

        <h2> What are the main causes of climate change in America?</h2>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims that "greenhouse gas emissions have increased the greenhouse effect and caused the earth's surface temperature to rise"(EPA editors). human-caused greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), such as those from the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, energy, and industrial operations, are the principal contributors to climate change in the United States. Included are the gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases.

            </div> 
            Overall, human activities that generate GHGs, especially through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and land-use changes, are the primary causes of climate change in America, just as they are the primary causes of climate change worldwide. A variety of solutions will be needed to combat climate change, including the use of renewable energy, the promotion of energy efficiency, the reduction of transportation emissions, the preservation of forests, and the implementation of climate-smart urban planning.

        <h2>Who is to blame for climate change?</h2>
        <p>There is no one organization or person who can be solely blamed for the problem of climate change because it is so complicated and varied. A variety of human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, as well as natural phenomena like volcanic eruptions and solar activity, all contribute to climate change.</p>
            <p>
                Prior to the industrial revolution, The earth's climate was influenced mainly by Changes in the earth's orbit and its axis of rotation which effects how much sun a given part of the world recieves at one given time, Changes in the sun's energy output which can effect how much energy the sun emits towards earth, And Volcanoes released large amounts of co2 and cooling aerosols such as sulfur oxide. However, these factors do not line up to the increasing temperatures (EPA).

            <p>
                Both https://www.technologyreview.com and https://harvardpolitics.com scientists believe that industrialized nations such as the United States and the European Union are to blame for climate change. According to Technology Review, "The US is by far the largest historical emitter, responsible for over 20% of all emissions, and the EU is close behind. China falls to third when climate pollution is tallied this way, with about half the US's total contribution"(Crownhart). The Technology Review piece also points out that the US, which accounts for half of all North American emissions, is by far the highest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions per capita.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the end, no one group or person can be solely held responsible for the effects of climate change. Instead, addressing this urgent global issue is a common responsibility that necessitates cooperation and action from all governments and stakeholders.</p>

        <h2>Is there corporate incentive to deny climate change?</h2>
        <p>Compelling evidence indicates that some businesses may have a financial incentive to downplay or deny the existence of climate change or to oppose regulations meant to lessen its effects.</p>

        <p>The authors of the Leaflet.org discuss how some businesses have actively pushed back against climate action and encouraged climate denialism. ExxonMobil, which has been charged with sponsoring organizations that deny global warming, and the American Petroleum Institute, which has long pushed against climate policies, are cited as examples. According to the report, these businesses might be motivated by a desire to preserve their profits by continuing to market fossil fuels and avoiding the expenses associated with moving to a low-carbon economy.
        
        According to the Stanford Social Innovation Review, corporate sustainability programs frequently fall short of addressing the underlying causes of environmental issues, such as climate change. It implies that some businesses might use sustainability initiatives as a cover for status quo preservation while avoiding more radical changes that might jeopardize their earnings or market dominance.
            
        While there is evidence that certain companies have engaged in these practices for economic reward, worries about market competition or ideological beliefs, It's vital to remember that numerous businesses are also making efforts to lessen their carbon footprints and advance sustainability. And that business leaders have a crucial role to play in promoting strict climate regulations and aiding the shift to a low-carbon economy.

        <h2> Is it too late to combat climate change? If not, what steps should we take to mitigate damages caused by climate change</h2>
        <p>Even while the effects of climate change are already being felt all across the world, it is still possible to take steps to lessen their severity and stop further warming. NASA estimates that there is a fast shrinking window of opportunity to keep global warming to 1.5Â°C over pre-industrial levels, but even if we go beyond this limit, cutting emissions and moving to a low-carbon economy can still stop much more warming and disastrous effects.
	
            In order to mitigate the damages caused by climate change, individuals, businesses, and governments can take a number of steps including:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Transition to renewable energy sources: The burning of fossil fuels is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions across the world.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Plant more trees: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and can help to offset emissions.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Adapt to the effects of climate change: Although mitigation measures are crucial, it's also critical to get ready for the effects of climate change that are already being felt. Such as building sea walls to protect costal cities, or improve water storage to combat droughts.</li>
